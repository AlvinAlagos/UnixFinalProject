# UnixFinalProject
For my final project, i will be developping a GNU/LINUX web server being runned on a VPS.
It will deploy websites online that will be based off my Internet Programming's final project.
I will be preforming basic sysadmin tasks such as creating users, SSH authentication,
etc. This readme file will be updated as i progress through the project
