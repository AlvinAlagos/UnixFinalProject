## Scenario:
My scenario for this project was to fully set up a GNU/Linux web server and deploy websites online. The web server will be hosted by a VPS that i chose and the provider is digital ocean. When it comes to handling the vps i would have to perform basic sysadmin tasks such as create user, ssh authentication, system upgrade, etc. As for the website contents it will be my final project in the internet programming class.

## Decision: 
So i had chosen two solutions for my scenario, and it was to either let apache2 or nginx run my website. After doing some research on both of them, i came to the conlcusion to use nginx since it is faster compared to apache2.

## Git Respository: 
Currently in my Git repository, you will find my journals and install file which are the steps to following how i set up my website. There is also the license and a readme file where you will find the explanation of my scenario.

## Automated Task:
As for my automated task, i haven't actually decided yet on what kind of task i would have automated. I was thinking about maybe everytime a user logs into the vps, it automatically updates and upgrades the system. Still as yet to be decided.

## Major Struggles:
For the major struggles of this project experience, it was very confusing on what i was gonna be developing at first. I didn't really understood any instructions but i was able to understand a bit more as time advanced. 

## Major Achievements: 
While working on the VPS and web servers, i was able to learn more about them and understand more about them.
## Lesson Learned from the project
With this project i kinda procastinated when it came to working on it. So my lesson from this project was to manage time properly.
