## Scenario:
So the chosen scenario i had for this project was to host a web server on a Virtual Private server. On the web server i will be running my website that was developed in my internet programming class
## Decision: 
So i had chosen two solutions for my scenario, and it was to either let apache2 or nginx run my website. After doing some research on both of them, i came to the conlcusion to use nginx since it is faster compared to apache2.

## Git Respository: 
Currently in my Git repository, you will find my journals and install file which are the steps to following how i set up my website. There is also the license and a readme file where you will find the explanation of my scenario.

## Automated Task:
As for my automated task, i haven't actually decided yet on what kind of task i would have automated. I was thinking about maybe everytime a user logs into the vps, it automatically updates and upgrades the system. Still as yet to be decided.

## Major Struggles:
For the major struggles of this project experience, it was very confusing on what i was gonna be developing at first. I didn't really understood any instructions but i was able to understand a bit more as time advanced. 

## Major Achievements: 
While working on the VPS and web servers, i was able to learn more about them and i can see more potential projects i could do with them like maybe host a server for games for me and some friends.

## Lesson Learned from the project
With this project i kinda procastinated when it came to working on it. So my lesson from this project was to manage time properly.
